# Logistics Dashboard Visualisation Tool

This project is a logistics data dashboard developed in React (TypeScript) focused on the evaluation and integration of advanced data visualisation tools. It was created as part of a university research project exploring the capabilities of various libraries in the context of large-scale logistical datasets.

## Project Overview

The dashboard is designed to support analysis of logistics data through dynamic and interactive visualisations. Based on a thorough comparison of popular libraries, **Apache ECharts** was chosen as the core charting library due to its flexibility, high performance, and extensive visualisation options.

## Research-Driven Approach

Throughout the project, five visualisation tools were evaluated across multiple iterations:
- **Chart.js**
- **Apache ECharts**
- **Power BI**
- **Kepler.gl**
- **D3.js**

Each tool was assessed based on:
- Dataset scalability
- Visualisation flexibility
- Interactivity
- Data source integration
- Rendering performance
- Community support
- Licensing
- System compatibility

Apache ECharts emerged as the most balanced option for this project due to its performance and interactivity, despite limited native support for non-JSON data sources.
